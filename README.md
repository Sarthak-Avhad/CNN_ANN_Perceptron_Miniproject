# 🧠 CNN, ANN & Perceptron – Deep Learning Mini Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This mini project demonstrates and compares three core concepts of **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**:

- **Perceptron**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

The project is designed to help understand how learning complexity increases from a single-layer model (Perceptron) to deep architectures (CNN), and how each model is used for different types of problems.
